# File Management System with Automatic Compression

This module provides a secure file management system that automatically compresses files during upload, returns file URLs instead of server paths, and implements comprehensive access control based on file privacy settings and user roles.

## üöÄ Key Features

### üîí Security & Access Control

- **No Server Path Exposure**: Server file paths are never returned in API responses
- **URL-Based Access**: Files are accessed via secure URLs with proper authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels for admins, uploaders, and regular users
- **Privacy Controls**: Public and private file support with appropriate access restrictions

### üìÅ File Management

- **Upload Support**: Single and multiple file uploads with metadata
- **File Organization**: Entity-based file organization (KPI entries, user profiles, etc.)
- **Metadata Management**: Description, tags, expiration dates, and privacy settings
- **File Compression**: ZIP archive creation for multiple files
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive file usage statistics

### üóúÔ∏è Advanced Image Compression

- **Sharp-Based Processing**: Uses Sharp for high-quality image compression and optimization
- **Multiple Formats**: Generates both compressed PNG and WebP versions
- **Smart Resizing**: Automatically resizes large images while maintaining quality
- **UUID Organization**: Creates unique folders for each file's compressed versions
- **Consistent Naming**: Files follow `{userId}_{fileId}.{ext}` naming convention
- **WebP Support**: Modern format with superior compression ratios
- **Configurable**: Compression settings can be adjusted globally or per upload

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# File compression settings
ENABLE_FILE_COMPRESSION=true
COMPRESSION_QUALITY=85
COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD_SIZE=102400  # 100KB - images are always compressed regardless of size
COMPRESS_IMAGE_TYPES=true
COMPRESS_PDF_TYPES=false
COMPRESS_TEXT_TYPES=true

# Base URL for file access
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Compression Settings

| Setting                      | Default  | Description                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `ENABLE_FILE_COMPRESSION`    | `true`   | Enable/disable automatic compression globally |
| `COMPRESSION_QUALITY`        | `85`     | Compression quality (0-100)                   |
| `COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD_SIZE` | `102400` | Minimum file size for compression (100KB)     |
| `COMPRESS_IMAGE_TYPES`       | `true`   | Compress image files                          |
| `COMPRESS_PDF_TYPES`         | `false`  | Compress PDF files                            |

## üìã Access Control Rules

### Public Files

- **Access**: Available to all authenticated users
- **Download**: Available to all authenticated users
- **URLs**: Always provided in responses

### Private Files

- **Access**: Only available to the file uploader and admin users
- **Download**: Only available to the file uploader and admin users
- **URLs**: Only provided to users with access permissions

### Admin Users

- **Access**: Can access all files (public and private)
- **Management**: Can update, delete, and manage any file
- **Statistics**: Can view comprehensive system statistics
- **Cleanup**: Can perform file cleanup operations

## üóúÔ∏è Compression Features

### Automatic Compression During Upload

Files are automatically compressed during upload if they meet the following criteria:

1. **Size Threshold**: File size exceeds `COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD_SIZE`
2. **File Type**: File type is configured for compression
3. **Benefit Analysis**: Compression provides at least 5% size reduction

### Image Compression Process

#### Image Processing

- **Engine**: Sharp (high-performance image processing)
- **Resizing**: Automatically resizes images larger than 1920x1080
- **Quality**: Configurable quality settings (default: 85%)
- **Formats**: Generates both PNG and WebP versions

#### Folder Structure

```
uploads/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [uuid-folder-1]/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user123_file456.png (compressed PNG)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user123_file456.webp (WebP version)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [uuid-folder-2]/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user789_file789.png
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user789_file789.webp
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

#### Compression Results

- **PNG**: Optimized PNG with quality settings and progressive encoding
- **WebP**: Modern format with superior compression (typically 50-70% smaller)
- **Naming**: Consistent `{userId}_{fileId}.{ext}` format
- **Organization**: UUID-based folders prevent naming conflicts

#### Text Files (Legacy)

- **Primary**: Brotli (better compression ratio)
- **Fallback**: Gzip (wider compatibility)
- **Target**: JSON, XML, CSV, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, plain text

#### PDF Files (Legacy)

- **Algorithm**: Gzip (additional compression on already compressed PDFs)
- **Note**: PDFs are already compressed, so additional compression may be minimal

### Compression Information

Each file response includes detailed compression information:

```json

## üîí Security Considerations

### File Access Security

- All file access requires authentication
- Server file paths are never exposed in responses
- Access control is enforced at both service and route levels
- Private files are only accessible to uploaders and admins

### Upload Security

- File type validation prevents malicious uploads
- File size limits prevent abuse
- Unique filename generation prevents conflicts
- Proper error handling for upload failures

### Compression Security

- Compression is applied only to files that meet criteria
- Compressed files are stored separately from originals
- Compression algorithms are secure and well-tested
- Failed compression doesn't affect file upload

### URL Security

- File URLs include authentication requirements
- URLs are generated based on user permissions
- No direct file system access through URLs
- Proper content-type headers for file serving

## üß™ Testing

### Test Compression Functionality

Create a test file and upload it:

```bash
# Create a large text file for testing
echo "This is a test file with repeated content. ".repeat(10000) > test-file.txt

# Upload with compression
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/files/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test-file.txt" \
  -F "isPublic=true"

# Check compression info in response
```

### Test Compression Disabled

```bash
# Upload without compression
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/files/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test-file.txt" \
  -F "enableCompression=false"
```

## üîß Integration Notes

### User Role Integration

The system expects user role information in the request object:

```typescript
// In your authentication middleware
req.user = {
  id: 'user-id',
  role: 'admin' | 'user' | 'manager',
};
```

### File Entity Integration

Files can be associated with different entities:

- `kpi-entry`: KPI entry documents
- `user-profile`: User profile pictures/documents
- `department`: Department-specific files
- `template`: System templates
- `other`: General files

### Frontend Integration

Frontend applications should:

- Use the provided `fileUrl` and `downloadUrl` for file access
- Check `canAccess` and `canDownload` flags before showing action buttons
- Display compression information to show space savings
- Handle access denied errors gracefully
- Implement proper loading states for file operations

### Compression Monitoring

Monitor compression effectiveness:

- Track compression ratios over time
- Monitor storage savings
- Adjust compression settings based on file types
- Consider implementing image optimization for better results

## üö® Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

```json
{
  "title": "Access Denied",
  "message": "You do not have permission to access this file",
  "success": false,
  "status": 401,
  "timestamp": "January 15, 2024 at 10:30 AM"
}
```

### Error Types

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid file upload or request data
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required or access denied
- `404 Not Found`: File not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server processing error

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Compression Performance

- Compression is applied asynchronously during upload
- Large files may take longer to process
- Consider implementing background compression for very large files
- Monitor compression CPU usage on high-traffic systems

### Storage Optimization

- Compressed files are stored separately
- Original files can be deleted after successful compression
- Implement cleanup for failed compression attempts
- Monitor storage usage and compression ratios

### Network Optimization

- Compressed files reduce bandwidth usage
- Consider implementing progressive compression
- Monitor upload/download speeds with compression
- Implement caching for frequently accessed files
